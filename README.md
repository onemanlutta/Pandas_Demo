# Pandas_Demo
In this project, I demonstrate how to use Python programming language to analyse a csv dataset. This work is fashioned after Corey Schafer's Tutorials on Pandas https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS. The dataset is from the Stock Overflow Annual Developer Survey of 2019.
